/**
 * Splits a UTF-8 encoded string into several, such that they are at most max_split_string_length
 * bytes in length.
 * First it goes in reverse over the last split_on_lookup_range bytes of a max_split_string_length
 * byte part of the string, trying to split on one of split_on codepoints. If no split_on codepoints
 * are found, it tries to split on the closest to the end of max_split_string_length bytes string
 * codepoint.
 * @param string UTF-8 encoded string to be split. Can't be NULL.
 * @param length Length of the string in bytes, excluding the null ternimator, if any. Can't be 0.
 * @param max_split_string_length Maximum allowed length in bytes of the split strings. Can be greater
 * than original string's length, in which case the original string will be returned in the callback.
 * Should be at least 4 bytes, because UTF-8 codepoints vary from 1 to 4 bytes and we don't split in
 * the middle of a codepoint, so we won't be able to split a single 4 byte codepoint into smaller
 * pieces.
 * @param split_on UTF-8 encoded and null terminated string containing codepoints that we would like
 * to split the string on. For example, " .,-ã€‚" would mean that we want to split the string on space,
 * dot, comma, dash and ideographic full stop. A split_on codepoint is kept in the split string.
 * This argument is optional and may be set to NULL to always split the sting at the nearest to
 * max_split_string_length codepoint.
 * @param split_on_lookup_range Length in bytes of how deep from the end of max_split_string_length
 * sized string to look for split_on codepoints. Can be set to at most max_split_string_length bytes.
 * Can't be 0. It's ignored if split_on is set to NULL.
 * @param callback Function to be called for each split string.
 * @param user_data Pointer that will be passed into the callback function. May be NULL.
 * @return true on success, false on failure. Failure indicates that invalid arguments were passed.
